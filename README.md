# Scheduler

## Purpose

To create an application that allows the user to schedule plan their day. The CSS and HTML will be dynamically updated through JavaScript and other third party APIs (jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.). Users can edit and save their appointments/tasks in the available blocks. Current time blocks will be highlighted in red while past time blocks are highlighted in grey. The future time blocks will be high lighted in green. These color-coded blocks allow the user to organize their day based on the time of the day and they can easily see the tasks that should have been completed and what they have left to do.
